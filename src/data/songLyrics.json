    "lyrics": "From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop) | At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts) | Taken far from my safety (The picture's there) | The memory won't escape me (But why should I care?) | From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop) | At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts) | Taken far from my safety (The picture's there) | The memory won't escape me (But why should I care?) | There's a place so dark, you can't see the end | (Skies cock back) And shock that which can't defend | The rain then sends dripping acidic questions | Forcefully, the power of suggestion | Then with the eyes shut, lookin' through the rust and rot, and dust | A small spot of light floods the floor | And pours over the rusted world of pretend | And the eyes ease open, and it's dark again | From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop) | At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts) | Taken far from my safety (The picture's there) | The memory won't escape me (But why should I care?) | In the memory, you'll find me | Eyes burning up | The darkness holding me tightly | Until the sun rises up | Movin' all around, screamin' of the ups and downs | Pollution manifested in perpetual sound | The wheels go round and the sunset creeps | Behind street lamps, chain-link, and concrete | A little piece of paper with a picture drawn | Floats on down the street 'til the wind is gone | And the memory now is like the picture was then | When the paper's crumpled up, it can't be perfect again | From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop) | At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts) | Taken far from my safety (The picture's there) | The memory won't escape me (But why should I care?) | From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop) | At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts) | Taken far from my safety (The picture's there) | The memory won't escape me (But why should I care?) | You might also like | Cure for the Itch | Linkin Park | A Place for My Head | Linkin Park | In the End | Linkin Park | In the memory, you'll find me | Eyes burning up | The darkness holding me tightly | Until the sun rises up | Now you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back | Tellin' you that I see it right through you | Now you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back | Tellin' you that I see it right through you | Now you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back | Tellin' you that I see it right through you | Now you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back | Tellin' you that I see it right through you | Now you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back | Tellin' you that I see it right through you | Now you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back | Tellin' you that I see it right through you | Now you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back | Tellin' you that I see it right through you | In the memory, you'll find me | Eyes burning up | The darkness holding me tightly | Until the sun rises up | In the memory, you will find me | Eyes burning up | The darkness holding me tightly | Until the sun rises up"
